# User Profile Microservice

This is the User Profile microservice of the RadioA sample application written as a demostration of the microservice architecture for the book [Coding an Architecture Style](https://leanpub.com/codinganarchitecturestyle). See also the others two microservices [Notifications Microservice](https://github.com/enriquemolinari/microservice-notifications) and [Competitions Microservice](https://github.com/enriquemolinari/microservice-competitions) from the RadioA sample application.

The book is completely **free** for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).
